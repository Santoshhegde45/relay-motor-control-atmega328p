## üí° How It Works

1. **Power Supply**
   - 24V DC input is stepped down to:
     - 12V for the motor using LM2596
     - 5V for microcontroller logic using 7805

2. **Control**
   - ATmega328P outputs a signal on a digital pin (e.g., PB0/D8)
   - This signal drives a transistor which activates the relay
   - The relay switches the 12V to the DC motor

3. **Protection**
   - Flyback diode protects the transistor from relay coil back EMF
   - Common ground ensures stable operation

## üõ†Ô∏è Microcontroller Setup

- 16 MHz crystal oscillator with 2√ó 22pF capacitors
- 10kŒ© pull-up resistor on RESET pin
- Optional UART connection (RX/TX) for programming via USB-TTL
- Code can be uploaded using Arduino as ISP or a programmer

---

## üß† Firmware

You can write the firmware using **Arduino IDE**.  
Basic logic:
```cpp
#define RELAY_PIN 8

void setup() {
  pinMode(RELAY_PIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, HIGH); // Turn motor ON
  delay(2000);
  digitalWrite(RELAY_PIN, LOW);  // Turn motor OFF
  delay(2000);
}
```
